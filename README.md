## Jets S3 Events Example

This project shows simple S3 event examples with [Jets](http://rubyonjets.com/).

## Usage

    git clone https://github.com/tongueroo/jets-s3-example demo
    cd demo
    # edit .env with your actual values
    bundle

Update [.env](.env) with your own values. Example .env:
